Write a program to generate the following 3 plots:
The CSV file data.csv in the current folder contains data about space missions since 1957.
The columns are: Company, Location, DateTime, Details and Outcome (Prelaunch Failure / Partial Failure / Failure / Success)
1. Create a pie plot that shows the distribution of mission outcomes. Ref: image1.png
2. Create a horizontal bar plot showing the total number of missions for each company, with the most at the top and the fewest at the bottom. Ref: image2.png
3. Create the same horizontal bar plot, but with the missions grouped into success and failure, with success in green and failure in red. Ref: image3.png
If you can see ways to improve the plots, or propose similar ones that convey the same information, please do so.
The program must be
- Free from syntax and runtime errors
- Contain Correct logic
- Good choice of variable/function names
- Sensible use of comments
