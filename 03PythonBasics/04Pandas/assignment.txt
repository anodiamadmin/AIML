The attached file data.csv contains data about flights along Australia's busiest domestic routes in 2019.
The columns are:
City1
City2
MonthNum
DistanceKm - the distance in kilometres between the two cities
AircraftTrips - the number of aircraft trips that month between the two cities
Seats - the number of available passenger trips that month between the two cities
PassengerTrips - the number of actual passenger trips that month between the two cities

Write a program in Python Pandas that answers the following questions: Write seperate and well documented functios for each of the parts and call tem from a main function.
1. What were the 10 busiest routes for the year, measured by actual passenger trips, and how many actual passenger trips did they have?
2. For every route, what was their busiest month number, measured by actual passenger trips, and how many actual passenger trips did it have that month? (If there is no unique busiest month, any month will do.) use idxmax() method of data frame 
3. During which month number were there the most actual passenger trips in total across all routes?
4. What were the 10 routes that had the highest proportion of vacant seats during the year, and what were their proportions of vacancy? Use the following logic:
   - First find the total seats in every route during the year
   - Then find the total passenger trips in each route during the year
   - Then calculate the vacancy proportion for each route during the year
   - Finally find the 10 routes that had the highest proportion of vacant seats during the year

Program must be:
- Correct logic for all questions (1 to 4)
- Free from syntax and runtime errors
- Good choice of variable/function names
- Sensible use of comments

Here is the kind of output that your program should produce:
