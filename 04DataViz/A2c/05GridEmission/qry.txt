Write me a python program that does the following:
Reads the "gridEmission.xlsx" file from the current directory.
Draws Line Plots in a .gif file year by year from 2015 till 2023 for EmissionIntensity (measured in tons per gigawatt hour (t/GWh)) and renewablePercentage (percentage electricity / power generated in Australia from renewable sources).
The plot should have dual Y axis.
Left Y axis: Renewable Percentage should be a bright green line chart of line-width = 4
Right Y axis: Emission Intensity should be a dark grey line chart of line-width = 4
use the file "Sydney.jpg" as background with alpha = 0.3.
Line Plot for every year should appear after 1 second.
X axis should be from 2014 to 2031.
year 2030 should have a dotted light blue vertical line of linewidth = 2.
82% renewablePercentage should have a dotted light blue horizontal line of linewidth = 2 with a label "Target for 2030: 82% Renewable Energy"

After the line plots are drawn for Renewable Percentage and Emission Intensity, draw a dark green dotted straight line of linewidth = 4 from the point (x=2023, y=35.14) to the point (x=2030, y=82), indicating the path required to meet the 2030 renewable energy target.

Font should be Oxygen. All field names, axis names, chart names, Index etc. and units should be Bold font.
X labels, Y labes, pointings, markings and labels should be normal (non bold) font. 
save the gif file as "gridEmission.gif" in the same directory.
