Subject: Driving Renewable Energy Transition Through Data Visualization
by Anirban Chakrabarty - Saturday, 10 May 2025, 9:56 PM

Switching to renewable energy is a critical measure in mitigating climate change. Under the Paris Agreement (2015), Australia has committed to two major targets:

82% renewable electricity by 2030
Net-zero emissions by 2050
Although Australia is on a promising path, achieving these targets requires informed action across individual, community, and policy levels. This is where data visualization becomes a vital communication tool—bridging the gap between technical data and behavioral change.

For this assessment, I have created the following visualization that showcases the percentage of renewable energy production by each Australian state and territory from the financial year 2008–09 to 2022–23.

Why I Chose This Example

This visualization transforms 15 years of raw electricity generation data into a geospatial and temporal map, helping Australians clearly see:

Which regions are leading in renewable transition.
Where progress has stagnated.
The overall national trajectory toward 2030 and 2050 targets.
By animating the state-wise renewable energy growth, the clip invites viewers to reflect on regional disparities and the urgency of action.

How It Is Effective in Driving Behavior Change

The effectiveness of this visualization lies in its clarity, context, and call to action. It addresses three key goals of behavior-driven data communication:

Awareness: Many Australians are unaware of how their state compares in renewable generation. This visualization reveals progress and gaps visually, fostering informed dialogue.
Motivation: States that are lagging can be inspired by leaders like Tasmania or the ACT. Highlighting local performance encourages civic pride or urgency for policy reform.
Actionability: Once individuals and policymakers understand where we stand, they are more likely to act. The visualization supports strategic behavioral shifts like:
Choosing green energy plans.
Installing solar panels.
Supporting pro-renewable policy platforms.
Further, at the civic and cultural level, this visualization helps normalize sustainable behavior and advocate for systemic reforms—reallocating fossil fuel subsidies, investing in public transport, and accelerating grid transitions.

In summary, effective data visualization doesn't just show what is happening—it inspires people to change what happens next. This map-based animation serves as a tool not just for reporting progress but for stimulating collective behavioral momentum toward Australia’s climate goals.
