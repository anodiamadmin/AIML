Human evolution is the approximately six-million-year process by which apelike ancestors developed into modern humans (Homo sapiens), characterized by traits such as bipedalism (walking on two legs), large brains, complex tool use, and language. Humans evolved in Africa and share a common ancestor with African great apes, with the human lineage branching off millions of years ago.
