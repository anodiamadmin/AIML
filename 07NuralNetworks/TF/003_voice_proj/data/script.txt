Machine learning turns data into predictions by learning patterns rather than following explicit rules. In supervised learning, labeled examples train models to classify images or forecast values. Unsupervised learning discovers structure, like clusters or anomalies, without labels. Training minimizes loss with gradient descent while regularization helps prevent overfitting. Neural networks stack layers to learn complex representations; transformers excel at language and vision. We evaluate using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, F1, and AUC. Robust pipelines include preprocessing, monitoring, and retraining. Responsible AI addresses bias, privacy, and transparency. Deployed models should be observable, reproducible, and optimized for latency and cost.
