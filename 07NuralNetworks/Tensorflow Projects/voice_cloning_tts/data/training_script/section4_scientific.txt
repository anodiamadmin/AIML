SECTION 4 â€“ SCIENTIFIC JARGON
-------------------------------------
In Deep Learning, neural networks consist of layers such as convolutional, recurrent, and transformer blocks.
Backpropagation is used to minimize the loss function through gradient descent.
Reinforcement Learning is based on agents, states, actions, and rewards.
Bayesian inference helps quantify uncertainty in predictions.
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, consist of a generator and a discriminator competing in a zero-sum game.
