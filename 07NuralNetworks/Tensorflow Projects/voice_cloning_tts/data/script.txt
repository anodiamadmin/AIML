Prince Harry has met his father King Charles at Clarence House in London on Wednesday for their first face to face meeting since February 2024.

The clues have been scattered all over the place in recent months.

In his BBC interview in May, there was a distinct shift in tone from the prince.

After the years of raw, emotional media appearances, the Netflix documentary series, the searing criticism of the royal family in his memoir Spare, this was a different Prince Harry in front of the cameras.

"I would love a reconciliation with my family," he said. "There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. Life is precious."

Prince Harry had made his position clear. He wanted to see his father but was the King feeling the same way?
